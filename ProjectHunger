Project Hunger:


A program that has a map of all the poverty and poor people in the area to donate to or give food too. More poor people and poverty will be noticed by the average human being. 
Develop demographics of an area
Run a test of how many people or programs the internet offers to see the poverty filled areas.
Create a social network where Poverty is notified and abolished.
Create a crash course app or website.
People who are highlighted on the map are sent either food from charities or other people who want to help.
Big charities have an easier way to find out where poverty is and feed Hungry people.
The more people there are the more charities have to give out, no more working and walking all day for poor people to eat.
